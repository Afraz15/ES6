// Old Java Script

var name = "Afraz"
console.log('Hello! My name is ' + name)
// this is how we concatenate a variable but it will result in an error if we use another quote

// ES6

var Name = "Afraz"
console.log(`Hello! My name's ${Name} and it's a pleasure to meet you...`)
// Instead of quotes we use `` <- these (don't know their names :p ) 
// To concatenate a variable, we use $ and {} ( Dollar sign and curly brackets )
// It won't disturb the data even if we use quotes
